* Mode-line Stats
This package contains several simple to use modules that display various system stats directly in Emacs mode-line.

* Installation
Just copy all the =.el= files into a directory in your Emacs =load-path= (such as =.emacs.d/site-lisp/=) and optionally =byte-compile-file= them.

* TODOs
- More misc stats.
- Redo =network-stats.el=.
- Add mode-line scrolling.
